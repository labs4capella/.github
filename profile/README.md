## Welcome to the Labs for Capella

It is the place where Capella users, as well as tool providers, can collaborate and create synergies to develop Capella add-ons, from the incubation state, with the option to reach an industrial level. Today Labs for Capella allows you to share your Capella add-ons, and to use those shared by others.
